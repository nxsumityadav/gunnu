Here's the full MVP blueprint for **Architect** — scoped to your exact stack (no auth, Tavily + Groq + Routeway, Netlify free + Neon free):

***

## The MVP Scope (Phase 1 + 2 only)

For now, the goal is: **Raw idea → Deep interrogation → Live research → PRD + Validation Report**. No auth, no payments, sessions managed by UUID cookie only.

***

## 🧱 Tech Stack Breakdown

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| LLM Brain | **Groq API** (llama3-70b or mixtral-8x7b) | All agent reasoning + streaming responses |
| Web Research | **Tavily Search API** | Live search: Reddit, Product Hunt, Google Trends |
| Routing | **Routeway** | Multi-agent orchestration (Conductor → PM → Research) |
| Database | **Neon** (PostgreSQL free) | Sessions, Foundation Docs, Validation Reports |
| Frontend | **Next.js → Netlify** | Chat UI + Report viewer |
| Auth | ❌ None | UUID cookie per session |

***

## 🔄 Routeway Agent Routing Logic

The **Conductor Agent** (Groq) reads session state and routes to the right specialist:

```
User Input
    │
    ▼
[Conductor Agent] ← Groq
    │
    ├── "needs_more_questions" → [PM Agent] → asks next structured question
    ├── "interrogation_complete" → [Research Agent] → fires Tavily queries
    ├── "research_done" → [Design Agent] → (Phase 3, future)
    └── "design_approved" → [Tech Spec Agent] → (Phase 4, future)
```

Conductor system prompt core:
```
You are the Conductor. Given session state + last user message, decide 
which agent runs next. Output ONLY JSON: 
{ "route": "pm_agent" | "research_agent" | "done" }
```

***

## Phase 1 — PM Agent (Deep Interrogation)

The **PM Agent** (Groq) asks 8 structured questions one at a time, streaming responses:

1. What's the single biggest pain point your product solves?
2. Who is your primary user? (one sentence)
3. What is the ONE action a user must do on Day 1?
4. Web app, mobile app, or both?
5. Do you need accounts / real-time features / payments?
6. Who are 2–3 indirect competitors you've noticed?
7. What should the user FEEL when using this? (calm, powerful, fast?)
8. Any visual brands or apps you admire aesthetically?

**Output saved to Neon as `foundation_docs` JSONB:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "idea_raw": "An app for book clubs to track shared highlights",
  "pain_point": "No shared annotation layer across readers",
  "primary_user": "Book club members aged 25–40",
  "core_action": "Highlight a passage and share with club in real-time",
  "platform": "Web app",
  "competitors": ["Kindle highlights", "Readwise", "Goodreads"],
  "desired_feel": "warm, literary, calm",
  "visual_inspiration": ["Notion", "Readwise"]
}
```

***

## Phase 2 — Research Agent (Tavily + Groq)

Auto-generates 4 Tavily queries from the Foundation Doc:
- `"book club app problems site:reddit.com"`
- `"shared reading highlights app Product Hunt"`
- `"Readwise alternatives complaints"`
- `"book club software market size 2025"`

**Output rendered as Validation Report:**
```
📊 VALIDATION REPORT
- 38 Reddit threads mention frustration with Goodreads' lack of real-time sharing
- Product Hunt: 3 apps in this space, all rated <3.5 stars for collaboration
- Key gap: No app offers group annotation + discussion in one view
- Your differentiator: Real-time co-highlighting with threaded discussion
- Market signal: "book club app" has 2.4x Google Trends growth in 18 months
```

## 🗄️ Neon DB Schema (MVP)

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  raw_idea TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'interrogation'
);

CREATE TABLE foundation_docs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  session_id UUID REFERENCES sessions(id),
  doc JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE validation_reports (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  session_id UUID REFERENCES sessions(id),
  report TEXT,
  search_results JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

***

## 🖥️ Frontend Pages (Next.js → Netlify)

- **`/`** — Landing: "Describe your product idea" → text input → creates session UUID
- **`/session/[id]`** — Streamed chat with PM Agent (Groq SSE)
- **`/session/[id]/report`** — Clean PDF-style view of Foundation Doc + Validation Report

***

## 🚀 4-Week Build Sequence

**Week 1 — Skeleton**
- Init Next.js, deploy to Netlify, connect Neon DB, test Groq stream + Tavily call

**Week 2 — PM Agent (Phase 1)**
- Routeway Conductor routing, PM Agent 8-question loop, save Foundation Doc to Neon, render it on `/report`

**Week 3 — Research Agent (Phase 2)**
- Auto-generate Tavily queries from Foundation Doc, Groq summarizes results, save + render Validation Report

**Week 4 — Polish + Ship**
- Error handling, mobile responsiveness, session sharing via URL, record demo

***

## 🔑 Environment Variables (Netlify)

```
GROQ_API_KEY=        # console.groq.com — free: 30 req/min
TAVILY_API_KEY=      # app.tavily.com — free: 1000 searches/month
DATABASE_URL=        # Neon PostgreSQL connection string
ROUTEWAY_API_KEY=    # Routeway dashboard
```

## Positioning vs. Competitors

| Tool | Where it starts | What it skips |
|---|---|---|
| Cursor / Devin | After specs exist | Discovery, validation |
| v0 / Bolt | After you know what to build | Research, strategy |
| **Architect** | **Raw idea stage** | Nothing — it's the full journey |

**Recommended name: Architect** — clean, brandable, signals what it does. Tagline: *"You have an idea. Architect turns it into a product."*

Want me to save this blueprint to your Notion workspace, or should I start generating the actual Next.js file structure and the Routeway agent config code next?
