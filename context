# 4 Use Cases for Architect

***

## Use Case 1: The Non-Technical Founder

**Who:** Priya, 28 — has a business idea, zero coding knowledge

**Situation:**
> *"I want to build an app where local tutors can list their services and students can book sessions. I have no idea where to start."*

**What She Does:**
1. Opens Architect → types her idea
2. Answers 7 MCQ questions (B2C, marketplace model, mobile + web)
3. Research phase finds: "Superprof and UrbanPro dominate but have poor UX and no real-time chat"
4. Picks "Warm & Friendly" design direction
5. Downloads `architect-bundle.md`
6. Opens Cursor → pastes file → says "Build this"

**What She Gets:**
- Validation that 10,000+ Reddit users complain about tutor discovery
- Full PRD, database schema, API spec
- Recommended stack: Next.js + Supabase + Stripe
- 5-step MVP plan starting from scratch

**Time saved:** 3–4 days of manual research and planning → **20 minutes**

## Use Case 2: The Indie Hacker

**Who:** Arjun, 24 — developer, wants to launch a SaaS fast

**Situation:**
> *"I want to build a tool that lets startup teams track their weekly OKRs without the complexity of Jira or Notion."*

**What He Does:**
1. Opens Architect → enters idea
2. MCQ answers: B2B, small teams, subscription model, ASAP launch
3. Research finds: "Linear is loved but no OKR tracking. Notion is too complex. Clear gap exists."
4. Builds design system: dark minimal, Inter font, 0px radius
5. Downloads bundle → drops into Windsurf

**What He Gets:**
- Competitor gap analysis with real Product Hunt data
- `.cursorrules` file pre-configured for his stack
- Granular dev plan: 40+ tasks from setup to deployment
- Confidence score: 8.5/10 — strong market signal

**Time saved:** Skip the "should I build this?" phase → **validated in 15 minutes**

## Use Case 3: The Design Agency

**Who:** Meera's agency — builds MVPs for startup clients

**Situation:**
> *Client walks in: "We want a platform for freelance photographers to sell presets and editing tutorials."*

**What They Do:**
1. Run Architect during the client discovery call (live)
2. Client answers MCQ questions themselves → instant alignment
3. Research phase shown to client on screen — real competitor data
4. Client picks design direction from 3 visual options
5. Both download the bundle at end of meeting

**What They Get:**
- PRD the client has already "approved" (they answered the questions)
- Design system ready to hand to developers
- Technical spec reduces back-and-forth with dev team
- Validation report to justify build decisions to client

**Time saved:** Discovery → spec usually takes 1 week → **done in 1 meeting**

## Use Case 4: The Student / First-Time Builder

**Who:** Rahul, 21 — CS student, first real project

**Situation:**
> *"I want to build something for my portfolio. Maybe a habit tracker but smarter — it uses AI to suggest habits based on your goals."*

**What He Does:**
1. Opens Architect → describes the idea loosely
2. MCQ interview helps him clarify his own thinking
3. Research shows: "Habitica and Streaks exist but no AI personalization layer — strong differentiator"
4. Uses design builder to pick colors and components → learns what a design system is
5. Downloads bundle → opens in Cursor for the first time

**What He Gets:**
- His first ever proper PRD (he didn't know what one was before)
- Database schema already written — doesn't have to figure it out
- A build plan that teaches him the right order to code things
- Portfolio project with real market research backing it

**Time saved:** Months of "where do I even start?" → **clear path in 20 minutes**
